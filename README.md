# Steve's configurations

This repository contains my personal configurations for
things like Windows, Linux, my terminals etc. I will 
therefore not accept any pull requests or changes to this repo.

Feel free to fork this repository or use it as an
inspiration for your own configurations.

Running the scripts here without knowing what they do
will most likely make you sad and/or change your
computer settings to something that you don't want.
